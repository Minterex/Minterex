Hi, there! I am @Minterex, or otherwise known as Mintz online or Travis():

  │ 👨‍💻 I have always admired coding and programming since a young age due to the environment I have grew up in. I plan to pursue it as a possible career path in the future.

  │ 💻 Currently learning the Python programming language! Once I am confident in my abilities, I will be trying to tackle C++ next.

  │ 🎮 One day, I hope to achieve my dream of becoming a game or software developer.
